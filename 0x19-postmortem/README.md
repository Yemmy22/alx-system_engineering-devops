INCIDENT SUMMARY:

At precisely 14:30 UTC on August 17th, 2024, the universe conspired against us, and 20 million users were suddenly thrust into the cruel, dark void of “Service Unavailable.” It was like the internet equivalent of forgetting your keys inside the house. For 92 excruciating minutes, our users couldn’t access a significant portion of our services, leading to widespread panic, social media meltdowns, and an alarming number of calls to customer service. The root cause? A mischievous bug that decided it would be hilarious to rename crucial configuration files with the wrong extensions, throwing our servers into a state of confusion.

Thank you, bug. Very funny.

TIMELINE:

14:30 UTC: Our ever-vigilant Datadog monitoring system shrieked in terror, and the Head of Engineering was paged. Meanwhile, Twitter and LinkedIn were already ablaze with users sharing their tales of woe.

14:48 UTC: The Head of Engineering, realizing this was beyond a mere “turn it off and on again” issue, paged an on-call network engineer. Unfortunately, this took 17 minutes longer than anyone would have liked. Maybe they were on their second coffee break?

15:05 UTC: The network engineer finally appeared, armed with Slack and an array of pings.

15:20 UTC: After some serious head-scratching and a few ICMP tests, the network engineer concluded that the network was, surprisingly, not the problem. But something smelled fishy, and it wasn’t lunch.

15:23 UTC: A full-stack engineer was called in as backup. We needed all hands on deck—and perhaps some extra brains.

15:33 UTC: The backend engineer started probing the system like Sherlock Holmes, only to discover that the server was playing hide-and-seek with some critical files. Spoiler alert: the server was losing.

16:02 UTC: After a tense 92 minutes, the issue was resolved, and our servers were back online, serving files like the heroes they were meant to be.

ROOT CAUSE AND RESOLUTION:

The root cause? A rogue code update that turned our servers into confused children looking for files that weren’t where they were supposed to be. This error was due to a file extension mismatch—an innocent typo with catastrophic consequences.

RESOLUTION:

We deployed the classic “ctrl+z” of server management: rolled back the update and reverted to the last known good configuration. We also ramped up our unaffected EC2 Auto Scaling Group to pick up the slack, disabled the overzealous Escalator autoscaler, and redeployed a corrected version of the configuration. It wasn’t glamorous, but it worked.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:

What can we improve? Apart from ensuring all code changes are thoroughly tested before release, we should consider:

Mandatory typo-checking bootcamp for all engineers.
Introducing a slow, cautious rollout for bulk operations—like tiptoeing through a minefield instead of charging in.
Implementing a secondary monitoring mechanism across clusters to catch these issues before they catch us.
In summary, we’ve learned that even the smallest mistakes can have a big impact. But with humor, resilience, and a good rollback strategy, we’ll keep our servers (and our users) happy.
